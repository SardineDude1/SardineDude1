- 👋 Hi, I’m @SardineDude1.
- 👀 I’m interested in library automation, saving time, learning, and having fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a whole bunch, mostly integrated library system API querying and data manipulation at the mo.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any tool that will improve public library services for patrons or staff. AR/VR tool development a plus.
- 📫 How to reach me sardinedude1dev@gmail.com. Please be patient... it's difficult to type with fins.
